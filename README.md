# My_Python_Learnings_for_Genomics
This repository contains several code blocks I wrote during my Python learning on the Coursera. 
This Codes are intended for answering basic biological questions🧬. 
I've wrote these codes to get the answers to questions asked in my exams for course completion. Though, I've also indulged with the main theme as bit of my own addition!🙂
One of this python files named "File_Path" is not directly related to the core theme, but it is used to execute a prompt as Graphical User Interface by which user can select the FASTA file of their selection from their device. So one should consider to import this file too while running the code.
Another file named "All_Tests_in_one" contains all Other modules imported with their respective functions. One can directly run this code blocks to get all the results. However, one should consider the size of the FASTA file for performing this code.
One can easily infere the function of other programs merely by looking at their names.
Happy to see you here!!!😊
